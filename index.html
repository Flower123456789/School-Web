               Mattie Kelly Art Center Galleries at Northwest Florida State College is pleased to present our newest exhibition opening Friday, January 22nd. The exhibit will be on display through March 5th.
This solo exhibition is composed of the artist’s traditional works of highly-staged digital photographic installations about nature and technology; for example, building materials as seen in Mass Foam #3, created with wall insulation. The artist will also debut three large-scale collage responses about humanity and nature intersecting in the Emerald Coast. Sarah is an international artist who teaches at a private college in upstate New York.

             Technology and the Internet are integral parts of the education process at NWF State College; therefore, students are expected to use computer technology and internet communication (email) throughout their college experience.

All classes offered at NWF State College may require the use of the Internet; such use may vary depending on the class delivery mode (traditional, hybrid, or online) and faculty preferences.

If you do not have computer and internet access at your home, you must be prepared to spend time on campus using computers to complete needed work. To help in this, NWF State College offers a number of open computer labs for student use and success.

                In an effort to be more environmentally responsible, LEGO have said they aim to stop manufacturing bricks made of plastic resin and are considering other options, which could include hemp. According to Telegraph World, the company makes 60 billion blocks a year. While LEGO want to replace the harmful plastic used in their products, they also require the new material to meet the high standards that allow the blocks to work as they always have, especially with the effective “clicking” together is a key aspect of the iconic coloured block.

               The perceived scale of the Amazon blazes received global attention this summer. However, international concerns raised at the time were countered by the Brazilian Government, which claimed the fire situation in August was 'normal' and 'below the historical average'.An international team of scientists writing in the journal Global Change Biology say the number of active fires in August was actually three times higher than in 2018 and the highest number since 2010.
